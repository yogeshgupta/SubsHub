How To Use~

SubsHub uses simple UI making it easy even for novice computer user.

Select the option of folder if you want to select a folder,where multiple video files are present and you want to get the 
subtitles for all the video files in a single instance.It is to be noted that the subhub will get you the subtitles of video files also present in the
subdirectory of the folder selected. Please note that currently you can only get the subs of video file with .avi extension
by using this method.We are currently working to get more video extensions working by using this approach.Though if you will
select those files individually you might will be able to get the subs for them.Please see below how to do that.

If you want to get a subtitle for a single file select the file option ,even if you will not by default you will be able to
select a file .This method supports multiple file extensions,though you will need to go inside the specific directory where 
your video file is present and select that video file .
